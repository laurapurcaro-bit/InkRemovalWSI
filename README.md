Ink removal of Whole Slide Images by color detection


## Introduction
Pathology specimens frequently have significant borders that must be recognized from gross inspection to microscopic examination1. 
Each boundary is usually marked with a different color of tissue-marking dye (TMD) or Indian ink, which aids in both macroscopic and microscopic identification2. 
The following are some of the benefits of using a variety of ink colors: 
1) To determine the margin status of a specimen 
2) To determine the orientation of a specimen 
3) To benefit from post-grossing three-dimensional reconstruction
4) To reduce identification error when multiple samples are required from the same tissue (e.g. prostate needle biopsies) or when similar specimens are obtained from different patients. 
Indeed, the presence or absence of ink is frequently the deciding factor in whether the margin is positive for tumor cells. 
In order to avoid error of interpretation, the most used colors are black, green, red, blue and yellow.
